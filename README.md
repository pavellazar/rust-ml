# rust-ml

This project aims to build Rust equivalents for the 10 most popular Python machine learning and AI libraries that are currently missing or incomplete in the Rust ecosystem. Each subpackage targets a specific Python library, providing a familiar high-level interface and idiomatic Rust design.

## Subpackages

- `tensorflow-rs`: Rust equivalent of TensorFlow
- `torch-rs`: Rust equivalent of PyTorch
- `scikit-learn-rs`: Rust equivalent of scikit-learn
- `keras-rs`: Rust equivalent of Keras
- `xgboost-rs`: Rust equivalent of XGBoost
- `lightgbm-rs`: Rust equivalent of LightGBM
- `catboost-rs`: Rust equivalent of CatBoost
- `nltk-rs`: Rust equivalent of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `spacy-rs`: Rust equivalent of spaCy
- `gensim-rs`: Rust equivalent of Gensim
- `transformers-rs`: Rust equivalent of HuggingFace Transformers

Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` describing the high-level interface and goals for the Rust implementation.

## Goals

- Provide idiomatic Rust APIs inspired by popular Python ML/AI libraries
- Enable seamless integration with the Rust ecosystem
- Focus on performance, safety, and usability

Contributions are welcome!

# keras-rs

A Rust equivalent of Keras, designed for fast prototyping and easy model building. The API will be inspired by Keras' Python interface, with a focus on modularity and extensibility.

## High-Level Interface

- Sequential and functional model APIs
- Layers, activations, and losses
- Training, evaluation, and prediction
- Model serialization

## Goals

- User-friendly deep learning
- Modular and extensible design
- Rust safety and performance

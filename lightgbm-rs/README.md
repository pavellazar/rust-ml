# lightgbm-rs

A Rust equivalent of LightGBM, focusing on fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting. The API will be inspired by LightGBM's Python interface, with Rust safety and speed.

## High-Level Interface

- Gradient boosting for classification and regression
- Efficient data loading
- Model training and prediction
- Feature importance

## Goals

- Fast and memory-efficient
- Distributed training support
- Consistent API

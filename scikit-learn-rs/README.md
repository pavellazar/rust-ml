# scikit-learn-rs

A Rust equivalent of scikit-learn, providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. The interface will be inspired by scikit-learn's Python API, with a focus on usability and performance.

## High-Level Interface

- Estimators: fit/predict/transform API
- Pipelines and model selection
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Classification, regression, clustering

## Goals

- Easy-to-use ML algorithms
- Consistent API
- Fast and safe implementations

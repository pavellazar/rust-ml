# spacy-rs

A Rust equivalent of spaCy, focusing on industrial-strength natural language processing. The API will be inspired by spaCy's Python interface, with Rust performance and safety.

## High-Level Interface
- Tokenization and linguistic annotations
- Named entity recognition
- Dependency parsing
- Pretrained pipelines

## Goals
- Fast NLP pipelines
- Easy integration
- Idiomatic Rust API

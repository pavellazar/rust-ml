# tensorflow-rs

A Rust equivalent of TensorFlow, aiming to provide a high-level, flexible, and performant API for building and training deep learning models. The interface will be inspired by TensorFlow's Python API, with idiomatic Rust design and safety.

## High-Level Interface

- Computational graphs and eager execution
- Layers, models, and optimizers
- Data pipelines and preprocessing
- GPU acceleration (where possible)

## Goals

- Easy model definition and training
- Interoperability with existing Rust crates
- Performance and safety

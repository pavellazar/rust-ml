# torch-rs

A Rust equivalent of PyTorch, focusing on dynamic computation graphs, tensor operations, and deep learning. The API will be inspired by PyTorch's Python interface, with Rust idioms and safety.

## High-Level Interface

- Tensors and automatic differentiation
- Neural network layers and modules
- Training loops and optimizers
- GPU support (where possible)

## Goals

- Flexible model building
- High performance
- Idiomatic Rust API

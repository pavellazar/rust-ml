# xgboost-rs

A Rust equivalent of XGBoost, providing scalable, distributed gradient boosting for machine learning. The API will be inspired by XGBoost's Python interface, with Rust idioms and performance.

## High-Level Interface

- Gradient boosting for classification and regression
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance and visualization
- Data loading and preprocessing

## Goals

- High performance
- Scalable and distributed training
- Easy-to-use API
